## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run Locally

If you want to run this application on your local machine for development or testing, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mmeetttt/attendence-managment-dashboard-app.git # Replace with your actual repo URL
    cd attendence-managment-dashboard-app
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows:
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set Up Environment Variables (for email sending):**
    For security, email credentials are not hardcoded. Create a `.streamlit` folder in your project root, and inside it, create a file named `secrets.toml`. Add your sender email and app password (or an application-specific password generated for your email provider) to this file:

    ```toml
    # .streamlit/secrets.toml
    SENDER_EMAIL = "your_sender_email@example.com"
    APP_PASSWORD = "your_app_password"
    ```

    **Important:** Do **NOT** commit `secrets.toml` to your public GitHub repository\! Add `.streamlit/secrets.toml` to your `.gitignore` file.

5.  **Run the Streamlit App:**

    ```bash
    streamlit run enhanced_attendance_app.py
    ```

    This will open the application in your web browser.
